#### Write PHP Code
- Open this folder: C:\xampp\htdocs
- Create a new file/folder: <b> test.php </b> or  <b> xyz/test.php </b>
- Add this code:
``` php
<? php
echo "PHP is working!";
?>
```

</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        Hey, This's a First PHP web-page
    </div>
    <?php       // opening tag
        echo "Hey, This's a first script of PHP";
    // Closing tag ?>      
</body>
</html>
```

```html
